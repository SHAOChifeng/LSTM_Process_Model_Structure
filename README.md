# Can recurrent neural networks learn process model structure?

This repository contains all process models, code and resutls concerning the paper "Can recurrent neural networks learn process model structure?"

The folder "Designed Models" contains the artificially generated models used (set 1)
The folder "Process Tree Generation" contains the notebooks used to generate and check the process trees (using the Process Tree generation tool of pm4py). Together with a folder containing both the trees and the converted petri nets.
